# Voting App Project
Biomedical engineering - web applications - voting application project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Web Application project. You will learn how to build
simple but shining voting application that can be used to carry out
a social experiment.
The goal is that by completing this project, you will understand
every layer of web application, including: SQL Data base, Object
Relational Mapper, MVC Pattern, HTML5 and CSS3, Jinja templates,
Responsive web design using Bootstrap, and data visualization with
Google chart.

## Project Instructions

1. Fork the repository to your githab account. It allows you to upload
the changes to your own github

    If you are new to github take a quick look here:
    https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

2. Clone the repository to your local PC

    Go to your home directory, and clone the repository.
    In case you made a copy (fork) provide your own URL
    ```
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/tstokrk/voting-flask-application.git
    cd voting-flask-application
    ```

3. Play with the code, and try to understand the whole data flow

4. Add information about your team on the first page. Change the survey
and all necessary data structures.

5. Prepare more statistics and data visualizations.

6. Commit and push all the changes to your own github repo

    ```
    git commit -m "My update..."
    git push origin master
    ```

7. Hints:

    * Try to develop your app using different IDE, e.g. PyCharm Edu, or
    Spyder - The Scientific Python Development Environment

    * Try to add small improvements to your app, and test if it's
    working every time.

    * Test the app on your desktop, and deploy it into your webserver or
    popular cloud. This step needs small modification, but you will find
    lots of examples easily.

    Below you will find popular service for
    deploying python application. Usually they offer a free model for
    a simple application.
